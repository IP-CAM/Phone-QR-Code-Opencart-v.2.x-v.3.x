# Phone QR Code for OpenCart
This is a simple OCmod for OpenCart that displays the client's phone number as a QR code within order view to allow easy dialing without retyping. I made it for myself because sometimes I need to talk with a customer when processing their order, and it has always been a pain for me to squint at the monitor and type the number by hand.

By showing the number in a machine-friendly format, I can now scan the phone number with my own smartphone and be sure I get it right.
The code should be compatible with all OC 2.x branches; it was tested on OC 2.1.0.2 and OC 2.3.0.1

# Installation
Just upload the OCmod via Extension installer and refresh the mod cache. You should get something like this:
